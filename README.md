# Neural Decoder

This project uses machine learning methods to create a neural decoder. A neural decoder is a model that has the ability to predict what stimiulus evoked some neural response. Neural decoders are useful in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) as the software that drives the transformation of a user's neural input into the BCI into intention to affect the environemnt. This project is guided by Kording Lab's paper on Machine Learning for Neural Decoding.

To run this code, open `hippocampal_neural_decoder.ipynb` and run all of the cells.
